        <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Cheesecake is probably my favorite cake. Here is a nice recipe for cheesecake.</p>
            <p>This is simply the best, most wonderful cheesecake I have ever had, and have ever made. It is based on a master recipe, from the master of baking herself, <em>Dorie Greenspan.</em> </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <h5>For the crust:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 3/4 cups (230g) Graham cracker crumbs (from about 15 Graham crackers)</li>

                    <li>4 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon (60g) unsalted butter (if using salted butter, omit the pinch of salt), melted</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>1 1/3 cups (270g) sugar</li>
                    <li>Pinch of salt </li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract </li>
                    <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>2/3 cup (160ml) sour cream, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>2/3 cup (160ml) heavy cream</li>
                </ul>
            <h5>For the sour cream topping:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups (475ml) sour cream</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup (35g) powdered sugar</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                </ul>
            <h5>For the raspberry sauce:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>12 ounces (340g) fresh raspberries</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup (100g) sugar</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup (120ml) water</li>
                </ul>
        <h5>Steps</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C), with rack in lower third of oven.</li> 
                <li>Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor or blender until finely ground. Put in a large bowl, and stir in the sugar and salt. Stir in the melted butter. </li>
                <li>Use a 9” x 2-3/4” round springform pan. Gently press down on the crumbs using your fingers, until the crumbs are a nice even layer at the bottom of the pan, with maybe just a slight rise along the inside edges of the pan.  </li>
                <li>Place the pan on a baking sheet and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Lower the oven temperature to 325°F (160°C). While the crust is cooling, you can skip ahead and start on the filling. Wait until the crust has cooled to wrap the pan in foil in the next step. </li>
                <li>Prepare the springform pan, so no water leaks into it while cooking. Place a large 18-inch by 18-inch square of heavy duty aluminum foil on a flat surface. </li>
                <li>Cut the cream cheese into chunks and place in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed for 4 minutes until smooth, soft and creamy. Add the sugar and beat for 4 minutes more. </li>
                <li>Add salt, vanilla, then eggs, then sour cream</li>
                <li>Add the heavy cream and mix on low speed until incorporated.</li>
                <li>Place the foil-wrapped springform pan in a large, high-sided roasting pan. Prepare 2 quarts of boiling water.</li>
                <li>Pour the cream cheese filling into the springform pan, over the graham cracker bottom layer. Smooth the top with a rubber spatula. </li>
                <li>Place the roasting pan with the springform pan in it into the oven on the lower rack. </li>
                <li>Without touching the hot oven, carefully pour the hot water into the roasting pan to create a water bath for the cheesecake, pouring until the water reaches halfway up the side of the springform pan, about 1 1/4 inches. (Alternatively, you can add the water before putting the pan in the oven, whichever is easier for you.) </li>
                <li>Bake at 325°F (160°C) for 1 1/2 hours. </li>
                <li> Turn the oven off and crack open the oven door 1 inch. Let the cheesecake cool in the oven, as the oven cools for another hour. This gentle cooling will help prevent the cheesecake surface from cracking. </li>
                <li>Carefully cover the top of the cheesecake with foil, so it doesn't actually touch the cheesecake. Chill in the refrigerator for a minimum of 4 hours, or overnight.</li>
                <li>Place sour cream in a medium sized bowl. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla, and stir until smooth. Chill until you are ready to serve the cake. </li>
                <li>Place raspberries, sugar, and water in a small saucepan. Use a potato masher to mash the raspberries. Heat on medium, whisking, about 5 minutes, until the sauce begins to thicken. Remove from heat, and let cool. </li>
                <li>Remove the cheesecake from the refrigerator. Remove the foil from the sides of the pan, and place the cake on your cake serving dish. Run the side of a blunt knife between the edge of the cake and the pan. </li>
                <li>Spread the top with the sour cream mixture. Serve plain or drizzle individual slices with raspberry sauce or sauce of your choice. </li>
            </ol>
