        <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Key Lime Pie is a Southern classic. Here is my favorite kind of Key Lime Pie.</p>
            <p>This recipe uses condensed milk and sour cream. Fabulously easy. . . a summertime favorite! If you have time, a homemade graham cracker crust is better! Garnish with whipped cream and thin slices of lime if you like. </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust </li>
                <li>3 cups sweetened condensed milk </li>
                <li>1/2 cup sour cream </li>
                <li>3/4 cup key lime juice </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon grated lime zest </li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li> 
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine condensed milk, sour cream, lime juice, and lime rind. Mix well and pour into graham cracker crust. </li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven for 5 to 8 minutes, until tiny pinhole bubbles burst on the surface of pie. DO NOT BROWN! Chill pie thoroughly before serving. Garnish with lime slices and whipped cream if desired.</li>
            </ol>
